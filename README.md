ChordRipple
===========
This web app is a search-box like interface for writing chord progressions.  Just type in chord names, and you'll see its ripples propagate down the list of autocompletions.  See substitutions, what's next, surrounding chords change, and continuations that lead you to the end of a phrase.

On a non-snowy day, you might be able to try it out at:
